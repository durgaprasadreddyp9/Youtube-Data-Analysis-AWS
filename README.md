This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and analyze structured and semi-structured YouTube video data based on video categories and trending metrics. It involves building a data ingestion mechanism to collect data from various sources, an ETL system to transform raw data, and a centralized data lake for storage. The system is designed to scale with increasing data volume and leverages AWS cloud services, including S3 for storage, IAM for access control, Glue for data integration, Athena for querying, Lambda for computing, and QuickSight for visualization. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes statistics on trending YouTube videos across multiple regions, containing details such as video titles, channel names, publication times, views, likes, comments, and category IDs.
